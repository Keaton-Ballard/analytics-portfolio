# Welcome to My Portfolio!

I'm Keaton Ballard, a data analyst passionate about using automation, analytics, and CRM strategy to drive smarter business decisions. This portfolio features data analysis projects from my master's program, alongside custom Python automations I developed to enhance HubSpot CRM workflows.

##  Academic Projects:  Healthcare Analytics (Master’s Program)

For my master’s program, I selected a synthetic dataset containing 10,000 rows of hospital patient data, including demographic information, medical history, and treatment outcomes like readmission and charges.

These projects span exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining—all focused on extracting actionable insights from healthcare data.

---

### [Project 1: Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory_analysis.ipynb)

Explored key variables linked to readmission outcomes using Chi-square tests, T-tests, and ANOVA. Identified statistically significant trends in patient behavior and conditions.

---

### [Project 2: Linear Regression Modeling](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Linear_regression.ipynb)

Built a linear regression model to quantify how variables like vitamin D levels, income, and age influence TotalCharge (average daily medical costs).

---

### [Project 3: Logistic Regression Modeling](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Logistic_regression.ipynb)

Used logistic regression to predict patient readmission risk based on chronic medical conditions and comorbidities.

---

### [Project 4: Data Mining - Classification Method](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data_mining_classification.ipynb)

Prepared and modeled structured data to classify readmission risk using feature selection, encoding, and supervised learning techniques.

---

### [Project 5: Data Mining - Prediction Method](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data_mining_prediction.ipynb)

Developed a regression-based model to estimate patient charges, using log transformations and a Random Forest Regressor to improve accuracy.

---

### [Project 6: Data Mining - Clustering Method](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data_mining_clustering_methods.ipynb)

Applied K-Means clustering to segment patients by demographics and charges. Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to optimize cluster selection.

---

### [Project 7: Data Mining - PCA Analysis](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data_mining_PCA.ipynb)

Reduced data dimensionality using PCA. Interpreted loading matrix and visualized variance contributions with scree plots.

---

### [Project 8: Data Mining - Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data_mining_market_basket_method.ipynb)

Performed association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm. Identified frequently co-occurring diagnoses and patient attributes.

---

## HubSpot Custom Code Projects 

These Python scripts were built to solve real business problems in HubSpot CRM by automating lead assignment, data cleaning, and record management. (Requires HubSpot Private App API key with proper scopes.)

---

### [Project 9: Weighted HubSpot Lead Distributor](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/keaton__ballard_portfolio/blob/main/weighted-hubspot-lead-distributor)


Distributes new contacts to sales reps based on weighted probabilities. A custom-coded solution that enables logic that is not available natively in HubSpot.


---

### [Project 10: HubSpot Record Meeting Associatior](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/keaton__ballard_portfolio/blob/main/hubspot-meeting-deal-associator)


Automatically links the most recently booked meeting with the most recent associated deal, ensuring reps have complete meeting context.


---

### [Project 11: HubSpot Phone Number Formatter](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/keaton__ballard_portfolio/blob/main/hubspot-phone-number-formatter)


Standardizes U.S. phone numbers in the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX. Includes error handling, API rate limit retries, and built-in validation.

---

### [Project 12: Hubspot Smart Record Merger](https://github.com/Keaton-Ballard/keaton__ballard_portfolio/blob/main/hubspot-smart-record-merger)


Automatically merges duplicate contact records using phone number or fallback logic based on first/last name match. Resolves inconsistencies caused by multi-source lead capture.
